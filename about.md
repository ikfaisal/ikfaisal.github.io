As a Software Developer for last 10 years, I have been analysing, developing softwares which mainly deals with historical data and wondering at the same time how data can influence future business decisions. While exploring this area I found that I need to learn math, statistics, machine learning algorithm to predict the future! That led me to GA and I have decided to take this course.

I have enjoyed the whole journey. Over the course of three months, I learned a variety of powerful tools like python, tableau, along with statistics, machine learning algorithm. I enjoyed NLP and classifier algorithm the most. To able to deploy the model to outer world based on machine learning algorithm was a special feeling.

I learned a different perspective to view the data. Going forward I'll like to mix my software engineering skills with my newly acquired skills in machine learning to build data driven solutions.
