To become a Data Scientist, it'll be a long journey. I'll try to document my journey here.

Will share code:

{% highlight python %}
def print_hi(name):
  print(f"Hi, {name}")
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

Will share my frustrations!

Will share my achievement! Even the small ones!
